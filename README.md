### Generate data with three classes with N = 1000 per class using random normal i.i.d. distributions with μ=[5 5]^T and Σ=0.1I, where I is an identity matrix, for Class 1, μ=[5 -5]^T and Σ=0.2I for Class 2, and μ=[-5 5]^T and Σ=0.3I for Class 3. Assume that this data ensemble represent three clusters of patients differentiated by feature vector μ as a result of a drug treatment marking recovery, partial recovery, and no recovery. Further assume that the data is coming from Institute 1. You received data from Institute 2 with same grouping of patients but corresponding feature vectors shifted due to batch effect by [x x]^T with additive and independent random variability distributed as multivariate normal with mean vector of zero and covarance matrix of σI. Assume cases with x taking values of -4, -2, 2, and 4, and σ taking values of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. Develop computer program for batch effect correction for each of these cases and interpret the results.
